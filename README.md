## Thought Process

I mainly chose this project in order to experiment with Redux Form, in addition to practicing my css and responsive skills.

Looking at a figma design file, I initially set up custom variables for colors, font size, and font family. Then, I created custom components used throughout the site like buttons (and their interactivity states) and any cards. Finally, I studied the grid layout and positioning of elements before I began coding.
